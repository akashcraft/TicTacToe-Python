# About TicTacToe-Python
TicTacToe in Python with clever AI

## Modes
There are two modes in the game:  
- Single Player Mode with AI  
- Double Player Mode  
  
Enter Player names and start!  
The Single Mode has a clever AI which is designed to defeat you so do keep an eye out ;)  
  
## Instructions
You must get at least 3X's in a row or column or diagonal to win (You know that :).  
This is how you must enter field inputs. Just use the numpad in your keyboard.  
Fields already occupied cannot be used again.
